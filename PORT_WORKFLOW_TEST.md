# Port GitHub Workflow Test

This is a test change to verify that Port can successfully create a GitHub branch and open a Pull Request.

- Jira Ticket: SCRUM-5
- Purpose: Validate end-to-end integration between Port and GitHub
- Note: Corrects a minor typo in the original Jira description ("workflo" → "workflow").

If you see this file in a new PR, the workflow is working as expected.
